 <h4>Mind Matters: Cognitive Science Gives Students a Taste of Computer Science, Linguistics, Philosophy And the Chance to Build Lego Robots </h4>
</center>
<p>Yes, the robots are made of Lego—but they’re more than mere toys. Every spring, students enrolled in the course Issues in Cognitive Science II, work with Lego Mindstorms EV3 robots, miniature rovers whose sensors allow them to discern light and colour, and judge shapes and distances; the students get the bots to follow tracks, avoid obstacles, and even play soccer (or at least tend goal). For the students, it’s a chance to investigate the nuts and bolts of perception, pattern recognition, mental representation, and more. These are issues that they’ve studied in the classroom, and now they get to see how they work in the real world, explains the course instructor, Professor James John, who also teaches in the Philosophy Department.</p>

<p>“ I thought that would be a really cool thing to do, to teach a course on foundational issues in cognitive science, where there’s a lab component in which the students have to tackle robotics assignments that deal with the foundational issues covered in the course,” he says.</p>
<p>
The combination of hands-on learning and comprehensive exploration of theoretical issues is just part of the reason that students are flocking to the Cognitive Science program (with about 360 students currently enrolled, the program is the College’s largest). The program’s popularity also parallels the explosion of interest in closely related technologies, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, which seem to be in the headlines almost daily. Toronto is poised to play a key role in the next phase of AI research, with the city hosting the newly-created Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence. University Professor Emeritus Geoffrey Hinton, a UC Emeritus faculty member, is the Institute’s Chief Scientific Advisor, while Ed Clark, a UC graduate (BA 1969) is Chair of the Board of Directors. There’s also a renewed scientific interest in the key questions posed by cognitive scientists—questions about the workings of the mind and the brain that have engaged philosophers since at least the time of Plato, but which have sparked rigorous scientific examination only in the last few decades.</p>
